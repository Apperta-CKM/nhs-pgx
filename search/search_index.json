PGx can help healthcare professionals make more informed and safer prescribing decisions, by providing live guidance on the optimal medicines and dose for each patient.</p> <p>Unlike many other types of genomic data, PGx results will be used across the health service by professionals who may not have any experience handling genetic information. PGx data can be generated from relatively simple lab tests that look for common genetic changes in genes which are involved in the metabolism of medicines.</p> <p>The presence of genetic changes in genes related to medicines metabolism can be used to classify people into different categories known as \"metaboliser\" status. For example, some people may have genetic changes which reduce the activity of an enzyme, making them a poor metaboliser, meaning they may break down medicines more slowly and may experience increased side effects or toxicity. Others may be ultra-rapid metabolisers, which means they might break down medicines very quickly, necessitating  higher doses or different medicines to achieve the desired effect.</p> <p>These PGx genes and associated changes in metabolism are relevant to many commonly prescribed medicines, such as anti-depressants, statins, and pain killers. As the prescribing of medicines occurs in several different care settings, access to PGx results is required across healthcare systems.
